#CH2-Appreciation

### Part 6

"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid（胆小的，害羞的） to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid." "I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives." "I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand." "The great Sisler's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age."
“你还记得那时他常来露台？我当时想带他去捕鱼，但我太胆小问他了。我让你去问他，但你也很胆小。”
“我知道。那真是大错特错。**（张：真不该那样；余：那是个大错。）**他可能会和我们一起去，然后我们在一起生活。”**（没能翻出意思。张：那就够我们快乐一辈子的。余：那真够我们乐一辈子的。）**
“我好想带伟大的迪马济去打鱼啊！”老人说。“他们说他父亲是一个渔人。可能他和我们一样的穷，这可以理解。”“伟大的西斯勒的父亲一点也不穷，他在我的年纪，已在一个大联队里面打球了。”

"When I was your age I was **before the mast**（水手）on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening." "I know. You told me." "Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?" "Baseball I think," the boy said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J. "He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball.

“当我像你这么大的时候，~~我之前在方形配帆的船开去非洲，~~ (我在去往非洲的帆船上当水手。）
晚上在沙滩上看到过狮子。”（余这里只有第一句用了主语“我”，后面都省略。）

“我知道，你告诉过我。”“我们谈非洲呢，还是棒球呢？”
“棒球吧，我想。”男孩说。（余：我想还是谈棒球吧。）
“给我讲讲伟大的约翰·杰·马格罗吧.”他说杰是指乔塔。 “在早些时候，他也来过露台几次。但他喝酒的时候，他就变得粗鲁，说话更难听。在他的脑子里，有马也有棒球。” 

At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone." "He was a great manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest." "Because he came here the most times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager." "Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?" "I think they are equal. "And the best fisherman is you." " No. I know others better."

“至少他一直会把马的名单放在口袋里，也常在电话里说起马的名字。”“他是一个不错的经理人。”男孩说。“我爸爸觉得他是最棒的。” （余张都译成「父亲」）

“因为他常来这里。”老人说。“如果杜洛歇每年都来这里的话，你爸爸会觉得他是最好的经理人。”

“谁是最好的经理人，说真的，是卢克还是麦克·贡萨洛？”“我觉得他俩差不多。”（余张译：不相上下。这里自己还是未能译出感觉。）

“最好的渔人就是你啦！”“没有，我认识有比我更好的。” （余：才不是。 张：不。喜欢余的译法。）


"Que va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you." "Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong. "There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say," "I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution." "You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace."

“哪里！”（余：哪里话！）男孩说。“有太多好的渔人，一些是很棒的。但你只有一个。”“谢谢你，你这么说我好开心。（余：你逗我开心了。）我希望没有大鱼出现，要不然，它会证明我们说的错了。”（余：我希望不会有太大的鱼来戳穿我们的大话。「戳穿，大话」搭配也是可以的。）
“是没有这种鱼的，如果你还是你说的这么强壮的话。”“我可能没你说的那么厉害。”老人说。“但我晓得很多诀窍，而且我有决心。”

“你现在得去睡觉了。明早你才有精神。我会把东西带回露台的。”


"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning." "You're my alarm clock." the boy said. "Age is my alarm clock," the old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?" "I don't know, the boy said. All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard." "I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken you in time." "I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior." "I know." "Sleep well old man.

“那晚安了。明早我会叫醒你。”“你就是我的闹钟。”男孩说。
“年龄就是我的闹钟。”老人说。
“为什么老人家都醒着么早？是因为想要一天生活更长吗？ ”
“我不知道。”男孩说。“我知道的是，年轻男孩尽情睡，而且睡很晚。”
“我知道了。”老人说。“我会准时叫醒你的。”
“我不太喜欢让他叫醒我。~~虽然是因为我比较自卑。~~”（余：那样显得我不中用。）
“我知道。”“好好休息，老人家。”


## Part 7
The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.
男孩走了。他们在没有灯的桌上吃的饭。老人脱掉裤子摸黑着上床睡觉。他把裤子卷起来，做成一个枕头，把报纸放在裤子里。他把他自己裹进毯子，睡在铺着一些旧报纸的弹簧床上。~~他熟睡了一阵~~（不久他便熟睡过去），梦见在非洲他还是一个小男孩，那里有长长的金色沙滩还有亮白的沙滩，亮得刺眼，高耸的海岬，还有高高连绵的褐色山脉。（余：还有高耸的海岬和褐色的大山。）


He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar(松油，柏油） and oakum（麻絮） of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning. Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads（锚定，停泊处） of the Canary Islands.
他现在每晚都住在沿海岸边。在梦里，他听到海浪的咆哮声，看见本地的船正开来。他睡着时能闻到甲板上松油和麻絮的气味，还闻到非洲的，（闻可译为「嗅」）那种晨起时微风带来的陆地气味。通常在他闻到陆地风吹来时就醒了，（余：把Usually译为「每逢」）穿好衣服，去叫醒男孩。但今晚这个气息来得太早，他也知道这个在梦里来太早，就继续做梦。梦里看见有白色顶峰的岛屿正从海中升起，（余： 梦见群岛的白峰从海底**涌起**）又梦见加纳利群岛的各种港口和停泊的地方。（余：又梦见加纳利群岛各式各样的港湾和近海的泊站。）


He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences（事件，发生，出现）, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk（黄昏，幽暗） and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.
他不再梦到风暴、或是女人、~~大事件~~（或是大场面）、或是大鱼、或是打斗、或是~~竞争~~（角力），或是他的妻子。如今他只梦到一些地方，还有沙滩上的狮子。他们像小猫一样在黄昏里嬉闹。他爱它们就像他爱男孩一样。他从没梦到过男孩。~~他醒来~~（余：他就这么醒来），看着在月光下的门，（余：透过敞开的门凝望晓月）把裤子摊开穿上，他在屋外小便后，就走上坡去叫醒男孩。（漏译「went up the road 走上去」) 


He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing. The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.
早上的寒冷让他直打哆嗦。（余：晓寒里他索索发抖）但他知道抖一会儿自己就会暖和，而且过不了多久他可以划船了。男孩住的房子，门没有锁。他打开，光着脚轻轻走进去。男孩睡在第一间房的小床上。借着透进来的残留月光，（余：借着落月透进来的清光）老人能清晰地看见他。他温柔地握住一只脚，直到男孩醒来，翻过身看着老人，老人示意点头。男孩从床边的椅子上拿过裤子，起身坐床，把它穿上。


The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry." "Que'va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do." They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats. When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.
老人走出门，男孩跟在后面，他还很困。老人把他的手搭在男孩的肩膀上说道，“抱歉哈。”“哪里！”男孩回。“这是一个男人得有的样子。” 他们一起走向老人的棚屋，一路漆黑，路上光着脚的男人，他们在忙着，扛着船的桅杆。在他们回到老人的棚屋后，男孩拿着篮子里一圈一圈的线，还有鱼钩和鱼叉。老人肩上则扛着卷好帆的桅杆。


## Part 8
"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked. "We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some." They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. "How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep. "Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today." "So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."
“你要喝咖啡吗？”男孩问。“我们把工具放在船上，然后就可以去了。”他们在为渔人供早餐的地方，~~喝了浓缩牛奶的咖啡~~。（他们用炼乳罐头来喝的咖啡。）“老人家，你睡的怎么样？ ” 男孩问。他渐渐有些醒了，但还是想睡觉。
“睡得很好，马诺林。”老人说。“我感觉我们今天有把握。” 
“我也这么觉得。”男孩说。
“我现在去拿我们的沙丁鱼，还有你的鱼饵。他帮我们带工具，因为他从来不想麻烦其他人。 ”


"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." "I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.

“我们不一样。”老人说。“在你五岁时，我就让你扛东西了。”
“我知道。”男孩说。“我等下就回来，然后再来一杯咖啡。我们可以记账的。”
他离开了，赤脚走在珊瑚石上，（余：踩着）走向放鱼饵的冰屋。老人慢慢喝着他的咖啡。他知道这是他一天仅有的一次，所以他得吃。~~他吃了很长的时间，感到无聊。~~ (改译：他对吃喝久已感到厌倦。余：近来他久已不甘饮食。）他从不带午饭。在小艇的船首有一瓶水，那是他一天的补给。


The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water. "Good luck old man." "Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars（桨，桨手） onto the thole（桨架） pins and, leaning forward against the thrust（推力，刺） of the blades（桨叶，刀） in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.

男孩回来了，拿着沙丁鱼和两个用报纸包起来的鱼饵。他们沿着小径向小艇走去，脚底踩着鹅卵石的沙子，抬起小艇，把它推进水里。
“祝你好运，老人家。”
“好运。”老人回道。他把有捆绑好的桨手绳子套在桨架钉上，~~向前斜靠在桨叶刺，放置于水中。**他渐渐划出海港，消失在黑暗里。~~ 
>（余：借着桨拨水之势，向前俯倾身子，便在昏暗中划出了港口。对比三个版本，还是余的翻译有画面感。）

There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills. Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.
其他（别处）海滩有正在出海的船。月亮已下山，老人虽然现在看不见，但能听到划桨推桨的声音。（余：木浆起落之声）有时会有人在小艇上说话，但多数船上很安静，除了那划桨声。他们各自在出港口后就分散而去，沿着他们期望能找到鱼的大海方向划去。老人知道他这次将要出远海。他把陆地的气息抛在后面，划入那干净初晨的大海气息。（余：气息）


He saw the phosphorescence（磷光） of the Gulf weed（马尾藻） in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well（深井） because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms（英寻） where all sorts of fish congregated（聚集） because of the swirl the current made against the steep（陡峭的，急剧的，升降的） walls of **the floor of the ocean.** Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools（鱼群） of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.
他看见墨西哥湾马尾藻从水里发出磷光。~~渔人说那是好征兆，在一个约七百英寻深的地方~~(改译，他划过渔人说的“深井”的地方，在那里突然深至七百英寻。水流触碰海底，形成的漩涡，许多鱼因此聚集一起。那里会聚拢许多虾，还有钓饵鱼，有时会有一群乌贼在深洞里。到晚上，当鱼群靠近水面，在捕食的大鱼就会把它们吃掉。


## Part 9
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.

黑暗中，老人感到黎明渐来。他能听到飞鱼飞出水面时发出的颤声，还有它们那僵硬（余：坚直）翅膀拍打出的嘶声，在黑暗中高耸地飞舞。他很爱飞鱼，（余：他非常喜欢飞鱼。）因为它是他海上最要好的朋友。（主要的伙伴，这里主要没有译出。）他为鸟儿们感到难过，（余：恻然；张：忧愁）特别（尤其）是那些精细小巧的黑燕鸥。它们不停地飞，寻觅，但几乎没寻到什么。他想着，这些鸟儿，比那些强盗鸟类和强壮的鸟，生活更困难。（余：鸟儿的日子比我们过的还要苦。自然那些掠食的的强壮的鸟儿食例外。）

Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea. He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.
为何他们把这些鸟儿造的如此精巧美丽（余：娇小精致）？大海很残酷，随时可能吞噬掉鸟儿。她也很友好也很美，但它也能变的残忍，这可以刹那间出现。比如鸟儿在飞翔，划水，寻觅，发出无力伤心的声音，由于长得过于娇小，它们无法对付大海。老人时常想，人人爱大海，在西班牙语里，他们把她叫作la mar。但有时，这些爱她的人，也会说她的坏话。但他们说她时的语气，总觉得她是一个女人。

Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys（浮标）as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld（保留，抑制，忍住，克制） great favors（善行，偏爱，赞同）, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.

那些年轻渔人，用浮标标界线。他们还有摩托艇，是用鲨鱼内脏卖的好钱买的。他们说大海是男性，叫el mar。他们说她，就像在说一个竞争对手，一个地方，或者一个敌人（余张：仇敌）。 但老人就觉得她更女性，总在给予或保留一种伟大的善行（余：会施大恩，或吝于恩）。如果她作出一些野蛮的或不道德的事（余：撒野作恶），那是因为她控制不住自己。他想，月亮影响着她，就像月亮影响一个女人。


He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour. I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonito（鲣鱼） and albacore（长鳍金枪鱼） are and maybe there will be a big one with them. Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.
他平稳地划着船，没有很费力。~~他保持着匀速~~，因为他保持着他平时的速度。水面很平静，除了偶尔的水流漩涡。他借用水流帮他三分之一的力量前行，在这短时间里，他已经比他预想的划行更远了。他想，我在深海地方捕了一周，但什么也没有收获。今天我会去有鲣鱼和长鳍金枪鱼的鱼群那里，说不定会碰到一条大鱼。~~在水流变更轻之前，~~ 在天亮之前，他把鱼饵放了出去，在水上漂浮着。

One bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish,tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-gar-land（半花环） on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could fell which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.
一个鱼饵已深入到四十英寻，第二个在七十五，第三，第四则已进入蓝色水底（余：深沉蓝色海水中），一个一百英寻，一个一百二十五英寻。每个鱼饵都朝下，~~钩上放着新鲜的沙丁鱼，勾身里装着鱼，~~（余：钩柄藏在饵鱼腹内。）绑好，缝结实，鱼钩所有突出的部分，弯钩，尖端都给包在了鱼肉里。每个沙丁鱼把它们两只眼睛勾住，它们在铁钩上看起来像半只花环。鱼钩每部分都充满着香甜可口。 

## Part 10
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas（金枪鱼，鲔鱼）, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets（铅锤，坠子，秤锤） and, on the others, he had a big blue runner（蓝鲹，体长约35厘米） and a yellow jack（金鲹，体长约40厘米） that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness.
男孩给了他两条小而新鲜的吞拿鱼（改译：两条新鲜的小吞拿鱼），也有可能是长鳍金枪鱼。它们挂在两条很深的线上，像秤锤一样。其他的，有之前用过的一条大蓝鲹和一条金鲹（余：黄梭鱼），现在它们也还不错，有上好的沙丁鱼保住它们的香味和吸引力。（余：有上好的沙丁鱼来增加香味和诱惑。）


Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped（烤干，烘干） stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line. 

Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise. The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current.

每条线像一支厚重的铅笔，缠绕在一个烘干了的木棍上。如果鱼饵有拉动或者触碰，木棍就会下坠，（余：如此饵上一有拉动，棍子便会浸水。） 
每条线有两个四十英寻长的线圈。可以系上别的线圈。如有必要，一条鱼可以拉出三百英寻的线。

（第一次这里没有译完，现在补上，除了个别单词的错译，还有句子没有译完整。）

老人现在看着这三根棍棒放靠在小船边，缓慢划向水，保持线上下平稳和适当的深度。（余：使钩索拖直，并且保持各自应有的深度。）天发白，现在太阳（在任何时候改译：随时）都会升起。太阳（余：旭日）从海上稀薄地（余张：淡淡地）升起。老人可以看见其他的小艇，在水上低浮着（余：紧贴水面），离开海岸，向水流散布开去。

Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred. But, he thought, I keep them with precision.

太阳慢慢变的很耀眼，强光照进水里，随着它全部升起（余：等它全轮升起），海平面反射太阳光到他的眼睛，眼睛刺痛，他没有望向太阳，继续划着。他望向水（余：俯视；张：朝下面的水里看），看着线直放下深水区。他把钓索弄得比其他人都直，这样可以确保在黑暗流（余：湾流深处）的每层，他希望，那里都有鱼饵在等着鱼游去。其他渔人则只是让鱼钩漂浮在水流里，有时会放到六十英寻，但渔人认为是一百英寻。但他想，我得要精确才行。

Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore. All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.

只有我没什么运气了。可谁知道呢？（余：可是谁又能预料呢？） 也许就是今天。每天都是新的一天。最好交好运（余：有运气当然好。张：运气好当然更好了。）。~~但我最好知道何时会有~~，(但我最好做得准确。）这样运气来的时候，我就准备好了。太阳已升起两小时。望向东边时，阳光不那么会伤他的眼。现在只有三只船，~~它们看起来很低，~~ 紧贴水面，~~在很远的向内岸。~~ 远靠岸边。他想，我的一生里（余：一辈子），早上的太阳几乎都伤过我的眼睛，但眼睛还是挺好的。（余：眼睛依然健好）~~在晚上没有全黑的情况下，我可以看见很深的地方。~~ 傍晚，我可以正视太阳，眼睛也不会发黑。~~晚上眼睛也更好，但早上就很痛苦了。~~ (余：落日的威力较大。可是旭日真伤眼睛。） 

Just then he saw a man-of-war bird（军舰鸟） with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again. "He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking." He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.
就在这时，他看见一双长黑色翅膀的军舰鸟，盘旋在他前面那片天空。它快速碰水，紧接斜着后掠的双翅膀俯冲，又继续盘旋着。“它肯定有捉到什么。”老人大声说。“它不只是在找食。”他缓慢平稳地向前划去，那是鸟儿盘旋的地方。他没有很急，继续保持他的线垂直上下。但他让水流有些急，这样他就还可以在正确的速度下
捕鱼。 


The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then be dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface. "Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin." He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow.
鸟在天空上飞高了，继续盘旋着。它的翅膀平衡不动。突然看起来像鸽子。老人看见飞鱼喷水而出，绝望地划过水面。“鲯鳅。”老人大喊到。“一只大鲯鳅。”他放着桨，从船首下面取出细线。鱼钩上有条铁丝导线和中等大小的鱼钩，他把一只沙丁鱼挂在了上面。他把鱼钩从船弦放下水里，将上端紧系在船尾一只拳头螺栓上。接着他给另一只鱼钩挂了鱼饵，把它盘绕着搁在船首的阴影里。

He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water. **As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish.** The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphins were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped.

他继续划着，看着长翅膀的黑鸟在捕食。现在都低过水面了。他看着鸟儿又点水，扇它的翅膀向水冲去。随后猛烈却徒劳无益地拍打着翅膀，追逐着飞鱼。老人看见大鲯鳅跃出，在追着逃跑的鱼，把水弄得微微鼓起。鲯鳅在飞掠的鱼下面破水而行，等飞鱼掉下，就快速地钻进水里。

It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast. He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.
他想，这可是一大群鲯鳅啊。他们遍布各处，飞鱼仅有一点机会，鸟就更没机会了。飞鱼太大，跑的也太快，他无法追上。他看着飞鱼一次又一次地跃出水面，鸟儿在那徒劳无益地飞来飞去。老人想，鱼群甩开了我，它们跑得太快，太远。但我可能会捡到一条迷路的，或者有条大的在它旁边呢。我那条大鱼肯定在某个地方等着我。


The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting（筛） of the plankton（浮游生物） in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish.
云层盖过大地，形似山群。海岸只有一条长的绿线，背靠蓝灰色山丘。海水现在变成了深蓝，蓝得近似紫色。他望向水，看见在深水里的红色浮游的筛子。还有当头的阳光所发出的奇异光线。他看着线垂直放下水直至看不见。他见到这么多的浮游生物，很开心，因为那代表有鱼。


The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized（有些形状的）, iridescent（晶莹剔透，彩虹色的）, gelatinous bladder（气泡，鱼鳔，囊，膀胱） of a Portuguese man of war（僧帽水母） floating close beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments（细丝） trailing a yard behind it in the water.

太阳在水里折射出的奇异光线，现在太阳更高了，是个好天气，还有云盖过大地的影子。鸟儿现在飞的已看不见。水面上没有什么，只有些发黄和太阳晒白的马尾海藻草。有些紫，形似彩虹色胶状的僧帽水母，紧靠船边漂浮着。随后飘向另一边，然后再右边。它随意漂浮，长而无生气的紫色细丝气泡在水里拖着一码的尾巴。
