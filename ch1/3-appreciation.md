# CH1——The Old Man and the Sea

## Part 1 

He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff(轻舟，小艇）in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty- four days now without taking a fish. 

老人独架轻舟，在墨西哥湾流域里捕鱼，至今已经过去八十四天，但他仍一无所获。
> (这里多少被之前上课时影响，有些偏向余光中的译法。）

In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’ s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao（不吉利的，倒霉）, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. 

在开始的四十天里，男孩与老人待在一起。但在四十天后仍没有捕到一只鱼时，男孩的父母告诉他，这个老人肯定不吉利，这种不吉利即是说是最不幸运的人。
> （这里不吉利余张都翻译成晦气星，我对definitely和finally没有译出。form of unlucky，余译成厄运。）

男孩听从了他父母的话，登上另一只船，他在第一周就捕到了三只上好的鱼。 
>（喜欢余的「三尾好鱼」，不过我的三只上好的鱼也可以。）

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines（线盘） or the gaff（鱼钩） and harpoon（鱼叉) and the sail that was furled（卷，收拢） around the mast（旗杆）. The sail was patched(修补，补丁） with flour sacks(面粉袋）and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. The old man was thin and gaunt（憔悴的，枯瘦的，荒凉的） with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. 

男孩看到老人每天空手归来而为他感到难过
>（余张把感到难过与后面的都断了句。我则是明显地把「made」译为「为他」）

他常去帮他收线、整理鱼钩、扛鱼叉，并把船帆收拢卷在旗杆上。
>（张是一卷卷的钩丝，或是鱼钩和鱼叉。余就直接用或-或-以及的连接。）

船帆是用面粉袋做的补丁，卷在一起，这看起来就像一面常败之旗。

老人很消瘦，憔悴，他的脖子有很深的颈纹。

>（张：老人瘦而憔悴，颈后有深的皱纹。余：老人瘦削而憔悴，颈背皱纹深刻。不知道这里余为何要译成「深刻」呢！ 比较喜欢张的译法。）

The brown blotches（斑点，污点，疙瘩） of the benevolent（良性的，仁慈的，慈善的，亲切的） skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep- creased（有皱纹的，有折痕的） scars from handling heavy fish on the cords（绳索，束缚）. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions（侵蚀，腐蚀） in a fishless（无鱼肉） desert. 

良性皮肤癌呈褐色的斑点，太阳从热带海域反射到他的脸颊上。

>（第一次翻译，不知道怎么翻出来的，完全没有读懂整句。）

他脸颊上凸起的褐色斑点，那是太阳照射热带海洋而长的良性皮肤瘤。 
>（第二次翻译，至少有那个意思了。这里余光中为啥要翻译成「善性」，有些不符合现代的说法呢！）
   
斑点长在他的脸下方，他的手有很深的纹痕，那是因为用绳子捕拉大鱼。这些纹痕都有些年岁了，**（这里我直接反译了）** 它们老得就像被侵蚀的无鱼沙漠一般。
>（张：「但是没有一个伤痕是新的，都是古老的，像一个没有鱼的沙漠里被风沙侵蚀的地层一样。」喜欢张的译法，很有意象。那平时在写作的时候是否就可以多采取比较好的比喻方式。）

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated. 

他的一切都很老旧，但除了他那双像海水一样碧蓝色的，透着愉悦和不可战败的坚定眼睛。
>（对比后的改译：他的一切都很老旧，但除了他那双像海水一样碧蓝色的眼睛，透着愉悦，和不可战败。）


“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up（拖，拉，捕获）. 
“圣地亚哥，”男孩在叫他，他们在小船停靠的地方下船走向岸边。
>（对比改译：「他们在小船停靠的地方爬下船走向岸边。」这里把『爬』字增加了）。

“I could go with you again. We’ ve made some money.” The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him. 
“No,” the old man said. 
“You’ re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”

“我又可以和你一起出海了。我们挣了些钱。”老人教会男孩捕鱼，男孩很爱他。
>（张余把「挣钱」都译的是赚钱）

“不了。”老人说道。
“你有一艘幸运船，好好利用它吧。”  
>（张：「你现在这条船运气好。你跟着他们吧。」我不知道为啥我译成利用。）

“But remember how you went eighty- seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.” 
“I remember,” the old man said. 

“你记得在开始的四十七天里我们没有捕到一只鱼，但接下来的三周里，每天我们都捕到过大鱼。”
>(删除冗余词，并，的，一只。张余everyday译成天天）
“我记得。” 老人回应道。

“I know you did not leave me because you doubted.” “It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.” 
“I know,” the old man said. 

“我知道你从未离开过我，因为你知道原因。”
“那是因为我的父亲逼我离开你。我只是一个小孩，所以我必须得听他的话。 ” 
>（前面一句译得不像小孩子的说的话。这里的必须must也不需要译出。）

“我知道的。” 老人说。

“It is quite normal.” 
“He hasn’ t much faith.” 
“No,” the old man said. 
“But we have. Haven’ t we?” 
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ ll take the stuff home.” “Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.” They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. 

“这很正常。”
“他对我们没有太大的信心。”
“是的。” 老人说。“但我们有，不是吗？”
“是的。”男孩说。
“我在露台酒吧请你喝一杯啤酒，然后我们再扛东西回家，怎么样？“
“当然可以。” 老人说。“只是两个捕鱼人之间的约定。” 
>（此处我译得不恰当。张：「有什么不行呢？大家都是渔夫。」，余：「好呀！打渔的还用客气吗！」)

他们端坐在露台酒吧，在一旁的许多捕鱼人在嘲笑老人，但老人并不生气。另外年老的渔人，看着老人，为他难过，但他们没有表露出来，而是很客气地说，目前漂流线的状况，和在这好天气他们的放线深度。
>（这里很喜欢余的翻译：「可是他们不动声色，却斯文地谈论暖流，谈论他们投索的的深度，稳定的好天气，和其他的经历。」看到这里，我注意到，我在翻译长句时，需要适当的断句。这样翻译也会更加准确。)


## Part 2 

The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered（屠杀） their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering（令人震惊的） at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted（吊起） on a block and tackle（滑车组，滑轮组）, their livers removed, their fins（鳍） cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting. 

收获颇丰的捕鱼人在当天已经早早回到，并已经捕杀好马林鱼，把它们放在两块拼接的木板上。
~~两个蹒跚的人站在木板末尾，等着有冰的拖车把这些鱼送到哈瓦那的市场上去。~~
>改译：两个蹒跚的人前后抬着走向鱼厂，等着有冰的货车，把这些鱼送到哈瓦那市场。

那些捕到鲨鱼的，他们把鲨鱼送到在海湾另一边的鲨鱼工厂里，把鱼吊在滑轮上。掏出鱼的肝脏，去掉鱼鳍，再剥掉外皮，处理好后，鲨鱼肉就被割成一条一条，准备盐腌制。(余：翻译简洁「去了肝，割了鳍，刮了皮。」这里的鱼皮按常识，真是「刮」字更合适。）

When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace. 

风从东边吹来时，会有气味从海港那边的鲨鱼厂吹过来；但今天的风是从北吹回来，只有一点微腥的味道，继而散开了。在酒吧这边只有惬意的阳光天气。
>（余：「每有东风，对湾的鲨鱼厂就会飘来一股腥气；可是今天只有一丝淡淡的气味，因为风向已由东转北，又渐渐平息，平台上阳光晴好。」简洁，词语也用得好，如「飘」，「淡淡的」『渐渐平息』，『阳光晴好』）

“Santiago,” the boy said. 
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago. 
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?” 
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.” 
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.” 
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said.“You are already a man.”

“圣地亚哥，”男孩叫到。
“怎么了，” 老人应道。他手握啤酒杯，正回忆多年以前的事。
>（余：「追想往日。」）

~~“明天我能帮你捕沙丁鱼吗？”~~
>余：「我去弄点沙丁鱼给你明天用，好不好？」

“不用，你去打棒球吧！我还可以划船，罗杰里奥会撒网。”
“但我想和你一起去。我不能帮你捕鱼，但我也可以做做其它事。”
“你请我喝啤酒了，”老人说道。
“你已经长大了。”

 “How old was I when you first took me in a boat?” 
 “Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?” 
** “I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.” 
** 
“Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?” “I remember everything from when we first went together.”

“第一次你带我出海的时候，我有多大？”
“五岁，那次你差点没命。~~那时我捕到一条活泼乱跳的鱼，~~ 
>（余：「当时我太早把鱼拉了上来」）那条鱼差点把船都给弄碎了，你记得吗？”

“我记得鱼尾在那重重拍打，打断了船的~~横梁，~~（译错：坐板）~~接着是一阵棍棒的声音。我记得你扔给我在船首的湿卷线，~~ 
>（余：「你用棍子打得砰砰响。我还记得你把我丢进放着湿绳圈的船头。」

然后感觉整个船都在颤抖摇晃，那发出的噪声就像你砍倒一棵树，我周身闻到甜甜的血腥味道。” 

“你真的记得这些吗？还是只是因为我刚刚告诉你的呢？”
“我清楚记得我们第一次出海的所有事情。” 
>（余：「从我们第一回一同出海起，我什么都记得。」）
 

The old man looked at him with his sunburned, confident loving eyes. “If you were my boy I’ d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’ s and your mother’ s and you are in a lucky boat.” “May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.” “I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.” “Let me get four fresh ones.” “One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises. “Two,” the boy said. “Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’ t steal them?” “I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”

老人用他那有过晒伤，但自信温暖的眼神看着他。**（张余：loving, 爱怜地）**说道“如果你是我的孩子，我会带你去赌一把，” “但你是你父母的孩子，你还在一个运气很好的船上。”

“我可以去捕沙丁鱼吗？我知道在哪里可以弄到四个鱼饵。” 
>（我总是把助动词给翻译在主语后面。余：「我去弄沙丁鱼好吗？」，后面可以调换位子，这样读起来更地道。）

“我有些是今天剩下的。它们用盐腌制放在了盒子里。”

~~“我去重新捕四条吧。”~~ (新鲜没有译出。余：「我去弄四条新鲜的。」）
“一条就好。” 老人说道。他从未失去过希望和信心。但现在更有精神了，就像清新的风吹起一样。
>（余：「他的希望和信心从不消失，如今正像微风渐起那么重新旺盛起来。」 这样的译法，很难。 这句英文本身也很难译。张，直接写「一阵风刮起来一样。」breeze为微风。） 

“捕两条吧，”男孩说道。
“好，那就两条。”老人同意地说道。
“你不会从箱子里直接拿吧？” 
>（steal 没有译出。） 
“我有可能会。” 男孩说道。“但这些是我买来的。”


“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.
 “Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said. 
 “Where are you going?” the boy asked.

“谢谢你。” 老人说。他太过单纯，而不去想他何时变得谦逊了。但他知道他变了，他也不觉得这是什么不好的事情，这是真的骄傲。
> （除了错译pride，还发现余光中在翻译的时候，尽量简洁，前面有了主语，后面就不写了，没有很多「他」出现。「他心地单纯，还不会自问何时变得如此谦虚。可是他自知已变谦虚，觉得如此并不可耻，也无损真正的自尊。」)

“明天湾流如果也是这样的话，应该会是一个好天气的。”他说。

”你要去哪里？“男孩问他。

## Part 3 

“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.” 
“I’ ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. 
“Then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid.” 
“He does not like to work too far out.” 
“No,” the boy said. 
“But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin.”

~~「在风向变换的时候我就要去到很远的地方。我想趁风还不大的时候出发。」~~ 
>(译错。余：「去远海，风向转变就回来，我想在天亮之前就出海。」

“我会想法让他出海很远的。” 男孩说。（张余都译出了「打鱼」）

“如果你真的抓到一只大鱼，我可以去帮你。”
“但他不喜欢航行太远。”
“嗯。”男孩回应。“但我可以看到他不能看到的东西，~~比如一只鸟，正在鲸鱼出现后引诱它出来。~~” 
>(这里翻译，是没有读懂英文全句。余：「譬如有鸟儿低飞寻鱼；我还可以引他出海去追鲯鳅。」）

“Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtling. That is what kills the eyes.” “But you went turtling for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.” “I am a strange old man.” “But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?” “I think so. And there are many tricks.” “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after the sardines.” They picked up the gear from the boat. 

“他的~~视力~~这么差吗？”（译错。张余直译成「眼睛」）
“他差不多~~看不见~~的。”（直接译“瞎”）
“奇怪。”老人说。“他从不去捕海龟。那很伤眼睛。”
“但你去过~~莫斯基托~~海岸捕了几年海龟，眼睛还是好的。” (mosquito 意译成蚊子海岸）

“我是一个怪老头。” 
“但你现在有能力捕大鱼了不是吗？”
“嗯，我想是的。而且也有很多诀窍。”
“我们把东西拿回家吧！”男孩提议说。“然后我可以去拿网捕沙丁鱼。”他们收起船上的装置。

The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard- braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft. 
The box with the baits(鱼饵） was under the stern（船尾，末端，严厉的） of the skiff（小艇，轻舟）along **with the club** that was used to subdue（征服，抑制，减轻） the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat. They walked up the road together to the old man’ s shack 
and went in through its open door. 

老人肩扛着桅杆，男孩则用木盒子装着硬编褐色线圈，还有鱼钩和鱼叉杆。
>（张：「鱼钩，鱼叉，和鱼叉的柄。」；余的翻译是正确的：「鱼钩和带柄的鱼叉」）

存放鱼饵的盒子和木棒一起放在小艇的尾部，有大鱼出现的时候就可立即制服它。没有人会偷老人的东西，但帆和重线最好收回家，有露水打湿就不好。尽管老人知道没人会偷他的东西，但他觉得鱼钩鱼叉，没必要留在船上引诱别人。

他们一起走向老人的棚屋，~~他们进屋，但那是不用开门的房屋。~~（改译：门开着，他们走进屋。）

The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made of the tough bud- shields（硬壳）of the royal palm（大王棕） which are called guano（鸟粪石） and in it there was a bed,a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt（泥土） floor to cook with charcoal（木炭）. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy（坚实的，坚定的） fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus（耶稣圣心图） and another of the Virgin of Cobre. （可布雷圣女图）

老人把缠着帆布的桅杆斜靠放墙上。
>（斜靠放，可以简洁。张用的「倚在」；余用的「靠在」）

男孩则把盒子和其他设备摆旁边。桅杆的长度差不多是棚屋的一间房那么长。(漏译「少有的，唯一的」） 棚屋由一种叫鸟粪石的大王棕的硬壳而制成，房间里面有一个床，一张桌子，一把椅子，和一处在泥地板上用木炭做饭的地方。
>（余直接写「内有一床、一桌、一椅」）

~~有褐色用结实的鸟粪石纤维，和叶子平整叠层的墙，~~
>（改译，纤维结实的鸟粪石和平整交叠的叶子，编成褐色墙。)

墙上挂着一幅彩色的耶稣圣心图，还有另一幅可布雷圣女图。

These were relics（遗迹物，纪念物）of his wife. Once there had been a tinted（带色彩的） photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt. “What do you have to eat?” the boy asked. “A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?” “No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?” “No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?” “Of course.” 

那些是他妻子留下的纪念物。之前墙上有一张她妻子的彩色照片，但后面取了下来，因为他看见会更触景伤情，感寂寞。他把照片存放在角落架子上的干净衣服里。    
>（under， 没有译出，应是「下面」）

“你有什么吃的？”男孩问。
“一碗有鱼的黄米饭，你想吃点吗？” 
“不用了，我回家吃。你想让我帮忙生火吗？”
“不了，我晚点生，我也可以直接吃冷饭。”
“我可以带走渔网吗？ “ 
”当然。” 


## Part 4 

There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too. 
“Eighty- five is a lucky number,” the old man said. 
“How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ ll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?” “Yes. I have yesterday’ s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not know whether yesterday’ s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from under the bed. “Perico gave it to me at the bodega（酒店，酒窖）,” he explained. “I’ ll be back when I have the sardines. I’ ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.” 
“The Yankees cannot lose.” 
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.” 
“Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.” 
“I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.” “Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sax of Chicago.” “You study it and tell me when I come back.” “Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty- five? Tomorrow is the eighty- fifth day.”


那里没有渔网，男孩记得他们已经卖掉了。但他们每天都会如此虚构一番。男孩也知道，那里也是没有黄米饭和鱼的。

“八十五是一个幸运数字，” 老人说。~~“你想看我穿这个价值千磅的东西吗？ ”~~ 
>(dress out没有理解透彻。应是剖干净。余：「你看我能不能捉一条大鱼回来，剖干净了，超过一千磅？」）

“我会弄到渔网，然后去捕沙丁鱼。~~你会坐在门前的太阳下吗？”~~(余：你坐在门口晒太阳好吗？ ）
“我会的。我有昨天的报纸，我会读读棒球的新闻。” 
>（这里read 是要译成「看」）

男孩不知道昨天的报纸是否也是虚构的。但老人从床底拿了出来。“佩里科在酒窖给我的。” 他解释道。
“我捕到沙丁鱼我就回来。~~我会把我俩明早的早餐都放冰上。~~（改译：我会把你我的放在冰上，早餐好一起吃。）

我回来时，你可以和我讲讲棒球的事。” 
”洋基队不会输。“
“但我担心克利夫兰的印第安队。”
“对洋基队有信心吧，孩子。想想出色的迪马济。” 
“我还担心底特律的老虎队和克利夫兰的印第安队。”
“注意了，你可能还会担心辛辛那提的红人队和芝加哥的白短袜队。” 
“你好好研究下，我回来你就告诉我情况。” ~~“你觉得我们该去彩票站买个八十五的号码吗？~~ 
>（terminal应是尾数或连号的意思。张：「你想我们可要买一张彩票？尾数要它是八十五，」） 明天就是第八十五天。”


“We can do that,” the boy said. “But what about the eighty- seven of your great record?” “It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty- five?” “I can order one.” “One sheet. That’ s two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?” “That’ s easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half.” “I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.” “Keep warm old man,” the boy said. “Remember we are in September.” “The month when the great fish come,” the old man said. “Anyone can be a fisherman in May.” “I go now for the sardines,” the boy said.

“可以买。”男孩接着说。
“但你之前买过的最好数字八十七怎么样？ ” 
>（记录没有译出。余：「可是你八十七天的伟大记录呢？ 」）

“八十七不可能中两次。你能找到八十五吗？”
“我可以买一个。” （order是订一张）
“一张，就是两块五。这钱我们可以向谁借呢？”
“那容易。我总能借到两块五。”
“我觉得我也可以。但我尽量不借。第一次你是借，第二次你就得求了。” 
>（余：「一次借。两次讨。」）

“记得保暖啊老人家，”男孩关心道。“要知道，现在是九月了。”
“这是大鱼出没的季节。”老人说。
“在五月，任何一个人都可以成捕鱼人。”
>（「任何一个人」课译成「谁」；另张余把捕鱼者译成「渔夫」）

“我现在去捕沙丁鱼啦！”男孩说。

When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man’ s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun. The old man’ s head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted. 

男孩回到时，老人熟睡在椅子上，太阳落山。男孩从床上拿来旧军毯，~~把它围在椅子和老人的肩膀上。~~（改译：把它铺在椅背上，盖着老人的肩膀。）
他的肩膀看起来很不一样，尽管很年老但仍很强壮，颈脖也很有力。老人熟睡，头向前垂着，颈纹看起来没有多少了。他的衬衫打了很多补丁，就像帆布一样，补丁被阳光晒得褪成了许多不同颜色。
>（余：「补过的地方也因日晒而褪成各种不同的色调。」）

老人的脑袋很年老，在他眼睛闭上时，却没一丝生命气息。报纸盖过他的膝盖，微风吹来的晚上，他手臂压着它。他赤着脚。



## Part 5

The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep. “Wake up old man,” the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man’ s knees. The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away. Then he smiled. “What have you got?” he asked. “Supper,” said the boy. “We’ re going to have supper.” “I’ m not very hungry.” “Come on and eat. You can’ t fish and not eat.” “I have,” the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then he started to fold the blanket. “Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You’ ll not fish without eating while I’ m alive.” 

男孩走了，（余：「男孩走时，他坐在那儿」）当他回去时，老人还在熟睡。“醒醒，老人家。” 男孩一边喊，他的手放在老人的膝盖上。老人睁开眼，过好一会儿他才从睡梦中醒来。
>（余：「刹那间，他从远方清醒回来。」）

他脸上挂着笑意。“你带回了啥？ ” 他问道。“晚饭” 男孩说。“我们马上吃晚饭。”“但我还不是很饿。”“一起吃点吧。你不可能捕鱼却不吃东西。”“我有吃的。”老人起身说着，拿着报纸把它折好，把一旁的毯子也叠了起来。

“盖好毯子。” 男孩关心说。“只要我在，你捕鱼就得要吃东西。” （我好像很习惯地意译。余：「只要我一天还活着，你总不会捉鱼时没东西吃。」）

“Then live a long time and take care of yourself,” the old man said. 
“What are we eating?”
 “Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.” The boy had brought them in a two- decker metal container from the Terrace. The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set. 

“Who gave this to you?” 
“Martin. The owner.” 
“I must thank him.” 
“I thanked him already,” the boy said. 
“You don’ t need to thank him.” 
“I’ ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,” the old man said. 
“Has he done this for us more than once?”

“那你要活久一点，也要照顾好你自己。”老人说。“我们吃什么？”

“黑豆饭，炸香蕉，还有一些炖肉。”男孩用双层的金属盒子装着，从露台酒吧带过去的。两套刀叉还有勺子，各自用餐巾纸包起来放在他的口袋里。
“谁给你这些的？ ”
“店主马丁。” “那要谢谢他了。”
“我已经谢过他了。”男孩回应说。“你没必要谢他的。”
“我到时送大鱼的腹肌肉给他。” 老人说。“他对我们一直这么热心吗？” （more than once没有译出。改译：「他对我们热心，不止一次了吧？」 ）


“I think so.” 
“I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for us.” 
“He sent two beers.” 
“I like the beer in cans best.” 
“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles.” 
“That’ s very kind of you,” the old man said. 
“Should we eat?” 
“I’ ve been asking you to,” the boy told him gently. 
“I have not wished to open the container until you were ready.” 
“I’ m ready now,” the old man said. 
“I only needed time to wash.” Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket. 

“嗯是的。” 
“那我得送比腹肌鱼肉更多的东西给他。他对我们很照顾。”
“他送了两瓶啤酒。”
“我最喜欢罐装啤酒。” 
“我知道。但这个是瓶装的，哈市依啤酒，~~喝完后，~~ 这些瓶子我会还回去。” （「喝完后，」多译。）
“你真好。”老人说。“我们可以开始了吗？ ”
“我一直在问你呢。”男孩温柔地说道。 “我得等你准备好了，我才会打开盒子。”
“我可以了。”老人说。
“我只是得要点时间洗洗。” 你在哪里洗的呢？ 男孩疑惑地想着。 村里的水在两条街以外。我得给他弄点水来。男孩打算着，还有肥皂，和好点的毛巾。我怎么这么粗心呢？我也得给他多买一件汗衫和外套，为这个冬天做准备，还有鞋子，毛毯。

“Tell me about the baseball,” the boy asked him. 
“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,” the old man said happily.
 “They lost today,” the boy told him. 
 “That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.” “They have other men on the team.”

“他们队里有其他人。” 
“那自然是，可他与众不同。在其他队，比如布鲁克林和费城，我会选布鲁克林，但我想起迪克·西斯勒和老公园里打出的精彩好球。” 

“这次的表现是以前从来没有过。他打出了我之前没有看到过的最远球。” （把longest ball确译成了长球。哎）
